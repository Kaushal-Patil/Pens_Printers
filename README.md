# Pens and Printers Analysis

## Introduction
Pens and Printers was founded in 1984 and provides high quality office products to large organizations. We are a trusted provider of everything from pens and notebooks to desk chairs and monitors. We don’t produce our own products but sell those made by other companies.

We have built long lasting relationships with our customers and they trust us to provide them with the best products for them. As the way in which consumers buy products is changing, our sales tactics have to change too. Launching a new product line is expensive and we need to make sure we are using the best techniques to sell the new product effectively. The best approach may vary for each new product so we need to learn quickly what works and what doesn’t. Six weeks ago we launched a new line of office stationery. Despite the world becoming increasingly digital, there is still demand for notebooks, pens and sticky notes. Our focus has been on selling products to enable our customers to be more creative, focused on tools for brainstorming. We have tested three different sales strategies for this, targeted email and phone calls, as well as combining the two.a:

## Business Metrics


The company's goal is to earn higher revenue using the best sales method. I would recommend that the company uses the average revenue amount of their preferred sales method as their metric.

Based on the data, Email + Call method has the highest sale revenue average (183 dollars). This is while Email (97 dollars) and Call (47 dollars) have lower average revenue (see graph 11). If their preferred sales method is Email + Call, the sales team should use its revenue average (183 dollars) as a baseline for whether a sale was more lucrative (above average) or not (below average).

Moreover, the sales team should recognize that sale averages overall and weekly are different since sale averages increase every week (see graph 6 and 11). Importantly, the first weeks could have lower revenue average amount than ($183), for instance.

## Conclusion

- I recommend that the company continues to use the Email + Call method since it captures the most revenue with the potential to significantly increase over time (see graph 11).
- I would recommend that the company uses the average revenue amount of their preferred sales method as their metric to monitor for strong and increasing sale revenues.
- Consider keeping the Email sale method for its inexpensive implementation.
- Consider stop using the Call method since it's expensive (30 minutes per customer) while having the lowest revenue amounts.
- Improve data collection:
    - Figure out why there are missing values in the revenue column (1074 missing in the data)
